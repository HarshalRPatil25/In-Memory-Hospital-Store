# In-Memory-Hospital-Store
 "In Memory Hospital Store" is a project aimed at managing kidney inventory within a hospital system. Users can view the number of available kidneys along with their health status. Additionally, they can add new kidneys and convert unhealthy kidneys to healthy ones. Unhealthy kidneys can also be removed from the inventory.
